                    <h4>Bio</h4>
                    <p>Sir Jonathan Paul Ive, KBE, HonFREng, RDI (born 27 February 1967) is a British industrial designer who is currently the chief design officer (CDO) of Apple and Chancellor of the Royal College of Art in London. He joined Apple in 1992 at the behest of its founder, Steve Jobs, to create its first rendition of the iMac. Following ten years of service, he was promoted to senior vice president of design, overseeing the design of the iPod, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and parts of Apple's user interface, iOS.
                    Born and raised in London, England, Ive studied design at University of Northumbria at Newcastle and had his work displayed at the Design Museum. After graduating, he was hired by a start-up design firm called Tangerine to work in their industrials group. Ive began working at Apple in the early 1990s, design the decade's PowerBooks and Macs. He was invited to join the Royal College of Art in May 2017 as its head-of-college, serving a fixed five-year term until May 2022.
                    His body of work–from his university years to present–has been influenced by the Bauhaus design tradition, in particular its focus on the credos "form follows function" and "less is more". German designer Dieter Rams has noted Ive's work as in-line with his ten principles of good design. Parallels in color stencil, structure, and lighting design can be found with the luxury German automotive, Audi. Ive frequently lends his voice–noted for its Essex accent and reserved, loquacious style of speech–to Apple's marketing and promotional videos.
                    Ive has received a number of accolades and honors for his designs and patents. In the United Kingdom, he has been appointed a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI), an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (HonFREng), and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In a 2004 BBC poll of cultural writers, Ive was ranked the most influential person in British culture. His designs, both negatively and positively received, have been noted as integral to the successes and failures of Apple.</p>

                    <h4>Early life and education</h4>
                    <p>Jonathan Paul Ive was born on 27 February 1967 in Chingford, London, England. His father, Michael Ive, was a silversmith who lectured at Middlesex Polytechnic, and his grandfather was an engineer. Raised just outside of London, Ive attended the Chingford Foundation School and Walton High School in Stafford where he studied sculpture and chemistry. After graduating from high school he explored the option of studying automotive design in London at some of the city's major universities. He briefly considered the Royal College of Art; however, he encountered a learning environment that was off-putting: "The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew". He attended Newcastle Polytechnic (later renamed University of Northumbria at Newcastle) during the late-1980s. While at university, some of his more notable designs–including a hearing aid design–were exhibited at the Design Museum in London. Ive graduated with a first class B.A. in industrial design in 1989.
                    His designs in university garnered him the RSA Student Design Award which afforded him a small stipend and a travel expense account to use on a trip to the United States. Ive traveled to Palo Alto, California, where he met with various design experts including Robert Brunner–a designer who ran a small consultancy firm that would later join a newly-founded company called Apple Computers. After returning to England six weeks later, Ive interned at product design agency Roberts Weaver Group (his college sponsor) where he impressed executives with a pronounced attention to detail and work ethic.</p>

                    <h4>Career</h4>
                    <p>
                            After a year with Roberts Weaver, Ive joined a London startup design agency called <em><b>Tangerine</b></em>, located in Hoxton Square where he designed a diverse array of products, such as microwave ovens, toilets, drills and toothbrushes. However, his frustration with the position reached a turning point after he designed a toilet, bidet and sink for client Ideal Standard, and the company's boss rejected Ive's work, stating that the products were too costly and looked too modern. Ive was unhappy working for clients whom he disliked and who didn't possess the same principles. From 1990 to 1992, Robert Brunner unsuccessfully attempted to recruit Ive to Apple, as he was ascending the corporate ladder. During this time Apple became a client of Tangerine's and Ive spearheaded the firm's initial PowerBook designs.

                            He was formally recruited to <em><b>Apple</b></em> as a full-time employee in September 1992 at the behest of Steve Jobs, the company's founder. Ive was initially apprehensive about leaving Tangerine for Apple as he thought the move from Britain to California would be tolling on his family. His first major assignment in Apple's industrial design group regarded the second generation of the Newton and the MessagePad 110. Initial design failures and lack of commercial success during the early 1990s, prompted Ive to nearly quit on multiple occasions. Jobs, who had been ousted by other Apple executives in 1985, was staging a return to the company and recruited Ive to join him in taking the firm in a different direction. Jon Rubinstein, Ive's boss at the time, managed to retain Ive as an employee by explaining that Apple was "going to make history" following the revival of the company in 1996.

                            He became the senior vice president of industrial design in 1997 after the return of Jobs, and subsequently headed the industrial design team responsible for most of the company's significant hardware products. Ive's first design assignment in this capacity was the iMac; it helped pave the way for many other designs such as the iPod and eventually the iPhone and the iPad. Ive explained the close rapport that existed in his working relationship with Jobs in 2014: "When we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same. And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things. Ive was given his own design office at Apple during the early 2000s in which he oversees the work of his appointed design team, and he is the only Apple designer with a private office. Only his core team—which consists of around 15 people from the U.K., the U.S., Japan, Australia, and New Zealand (who have worked together for around two decades)—and top Apple executives are allowed into the office, as it contains all of the concepts, including prototypes, that the design team is working on. Ive also refuses to allow his children or family members to enter the office. During the early 2010s, Jobs declared that Ive "[had] more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me." The offices of Jobs and Ive in Apple's Cupertino headquarters were linked through a hidden, built-in corridor with single-access doors. In 2011 it was reported that Ive was paid $30 million in base salary with a $25 million stock bonus in total compensation for the year. His compensation ceased to be publicly disclosed by the firm thereafter, rendering him the only Apple executive to be afforded such as provision. A year later it was estimated that his net worth was £80 million.

                            On 29 October 2012, Apple announced that Ive would "provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design." With the 2013 World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) announcement of iOS 7 and Ive's role as principal, Apple press information was also updated to reflect his new title: Senior Vice President of Design. In the same press update, Ive stated that he hoped his best work was yet to emerge and that he preferred to be identified as a maker of products, rather than a designer. On 26 May 2015, the firm announced that Ive was promoted to chief design officer (CDO) as one of only four C-level executives at Apple along with CEO Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri and COO Jeff Williams. On 8 December 2017, Apple announced that Ive would resume direct responsibility for the company's product design after spending the preceding two years in a more executive, non-creative role.
